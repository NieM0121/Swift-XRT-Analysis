## Notes
This project only performed simple processing of Swift/XRT observation data, and the results obtained were not completely consistent with the results given by the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

## Usage
The intended usage is shown in `xrt_analysis_processflow.ipynb` shows how to process data of SWIFT/XRT by using this project.
